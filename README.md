# RICE-LEAF-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN
Machine learning project to classify rice leaf diseases using image processing
## 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Machine Learning
### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying rice leaf diseases using image-based machine learning techniques. Rice is a staple crop, and early disease detection helps farmers reduce crop loss and improve yield.

The model is trained on a dataset of rice leaf images belonging to three disease categories:

Leaf Smut

Brown Spot

Bacterial Leaf Blight

The goal of this project is to classify diseased rice leaves accurately using image processing and ML techniques.
